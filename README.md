# PGMGen
A simple website to assist in generating XML files for [PvP Game Manager (PGM)](https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM) maps.

## Overview

> [!NOTE]  
> The final website is just looks only. It is **NOT** functional yet!

The goal of PGMGen is to simplify the XML process of mapmaking, which can often take a long time depending on the complexity of the map. While this project was never meant to replace traditional text editors and manually editing XML files, we believe that by providing a user-friendly interface with straightforward explanation for the various modules offered by PGM, it can greatly reduce the time needed to make a working map.

### Roadmap
PGMGen is still in its infancy. As such, new features are actively being worked on and implemented.

#### Supported Gamemodes
* TBD

#### Not implemented
* TBD

## Usage

* Clone this repository and run `npm install` in the project's directory.
* Run `npm run dev` to start a local development webserver.
    * By default, the website will be located at `http://localhost:5173/`.
* For deploying purposes, you can use `npm run build` to compile everything without launching the webserver.
