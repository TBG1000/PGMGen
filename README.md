# PGM XML Generator
A simple website to assist in generating XML files for [PvP Game Manager (PGM)](https://github.com/PGMDev/PGM) maps.

## Overview
The goal of PGM XML Generator is to simplify the XML creation process of mapmaking, which can often take a long time depending on the complexity of a map. While PGM XML Generator was never meant to replace traditional text editors and manually editing XML files, we believe that by providing a user-friendly interface with straightforward explanation for the various modules offered by PGM, it can greatly reduce the time needed to make a working map. In fact, the website is capable of generating an entire XML file from scratch without the need to edit a template to fit any maps.

### Roadmap
PGM XML Generator is still in its infancy. As such, new features are actively being worked on and implemented.
